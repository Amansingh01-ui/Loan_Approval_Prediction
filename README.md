# Loan Approval Prediction

## Model Used 
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

### About the Project
The objective of this data science project is to analyze the demographics of loan applicants and predict their loan approval status. The project focuses on understanding the key factors influencing loan approval by conducting exploratory data analysis. It was observed that loan approval is closely tied to certain variables such as CIBIL score, number of dependents, assets, loan amount, and tenure. Notably, applicants with a CIBIL score exceeding 600 exhibit higher chances of loan approval, while those with fewer dependents, specifically 0 or 1, are more likely to have their loans approved. Additionally, applicants with larger loan amounts and shorter tenures are inclined to receive loan approval. The project employs both the decision tree classifier and the random forest classifier for prediction tasks. Remarkably, the decision tree classifier outperformed the alternatives, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4%. This project sheds light on the intricate relationships within loan approval dynamics and provides insights to enhance lending decisions.
